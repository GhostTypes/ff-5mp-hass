See the Home Assistant Core documentation for intents for:

* [Built-in intents](/docs/intent_builtin) that are supported by Home Assistant.
* Use [the Conversation API](/docs/intent_conversation_api) to send text commands to Home Assistant and receive responses.
* [Register intent handlers](/docs/intent_handling) to add new intents to Home Assistant.
* [Fire intents](/docs/intent_firing) if you have your own sentence matching logic and want Home Assistant to handle the intents.
