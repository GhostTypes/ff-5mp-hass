An image entity can display a static image. Derive a platform entity from [`homeassistant.components.image.ImageEntity`](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/image/__init__.py).

The image entity is a simplified version of the [`camera`](/docs/core/entity/camera) entity, and supports serving a static image or an image URL that can be fetched.

An implementation can provide either a URL from where an image will automatically be fetched or image data as `bytes`. When providing a URL, the fetched image will be cached in `self._cached_image`, set `self._cached_image` to `None` to invalidate the cache.

## Properties

> **tip**
>
> Properties should always only return information from memory and not do I/O (like network requests). Implement `update()` or `async_update()` to fetch data.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| content\_type | str | `image/jpeg` | The content-type of the image, set automatically if the image entity provides a URL. |
| image\_last\_updated | `datetime.datetime | None` | `None` | Timestamp of when the image was last updated. Used to determine `state`. Frontend will call `image` or `async_image` after this changes. |
| image\_url | `str | None` | `UNDEFINED` | Optional URL from where the image should be fetched. |

## Methods

### Image

Implement `async_image` or `image` if your entity returns bytes of the image instead of providing a URL. Frontend will call `async_image` or `image` to fetch the image. If the image is fetched remotely, image data should be cached and the cache invalidated when `image_last_updated` is changed.

Note that:

* The image entity's `async_image` or `image` method is only called when frontend fetches the image.
* Frontend will:
  + Fetch the image once when a page with an image entity is loaded
  + Refetch the image when the image entity's state changed by the image entity changing `image_last_updated`

This means it's incorrect to bump the `image_last_updated` property inside `async def async_image`. Instead, the image entity should, when an updated image is available or periodically if the image should be refetched after some time, update the `image_last_updated` timestamp. This can for example happen as part of an entity coordinator update.

```
class MyImage(ImageEntity):
    # Implement one of these methods.

    def image(self) -> bytes | None:
        """Return bytes of image."""

    async def async_image(self) -> bytes | None:
        """Return bytes of image."""
```
